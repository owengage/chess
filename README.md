# C++ Chess engine WIP

A chess game/engine written in C++. So far all chess moves have been encoded in the game, allowing a user to generate
all posible moves allowable. This includes checking for en passant, castling, check, checkmate, and stalemate when no
moves are available.

## TODOs

* Stalemate through 'inactivity'
* Better chess viewer
* Automated chess player

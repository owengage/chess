# C++ Chess WIP

A chess game/engine written in C++. So far all chess moves have been encoded in the game, allowing a user to generate
all possible moves allowable. This includes checking for en passant, castling, check, checkmate, and stalemate when no
moves are available.

## TODOs

* Make promotion part of move generation so that they can be evaluated separately.
* Speed up move generation. Benchmark!
* Stalemate through 'inactivity'
* Better chess viewer
* Automated chess player
* Write Algebraic Notation or Portable Game Notation parser
